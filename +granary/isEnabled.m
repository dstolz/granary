function tf = isEnabled(level,dest)
% tf = granary.isEnabled(level)             would this message be emitted anywhere
% tf = granary.isEnabled(level,'console')   would it reach the command window
% tf = granary.isEnabled(level,'log')       would it reach the error log
% tf = granary.isEnabled(level,'any')       either of the above (the default)
%
% The verbosity gate for the whole logger, and the only place the verbosity
% globals are interpreted.
%
% There are two of them, because the command window and the error log answer
% different questions. GVerbosity keeps the console readable, so it stays low
% during a session; GLogVerbosity decides what is on the record afterwards, and
% defaults to Inf so EVERY message is written to the error log regardless of
% what the operator is watching. Turning the console quiet no longer throws
% away the detail that explains a failure after the fact.
%
%   GVerbosity    - console verbosity, an integer normally between -1 and 4
%                   (see granary.Level). Default 1.
%   GLogVerbosity - error-log verbosity, same scale. Default Inf (log
%                   everything). Lower it to restore the old behaviour where a
%                   suppressed message costs nothing at all.
%
% This is deliberately the cheapest thing in the package: on the suppressed
% path nothing is formatted, no timestamp is taken and no record is built. With
% the default GLogVerbosity nothing is suppressed, so a level-4 trace in a
% per-trial loop now pays for formatting and a file write -- lower
% GLogVerbosity on a rig where that matters.
%
% Guards both globals against values that silently broke the old comparison:
%   NaN       - "level > NaN" is always false, so EVERY message printed
%   []        - reset to the documented default
%   [0 3]     - an array made "if" require all elements, suppressing nothing
% Inf is repaired on GVerbosity, where it meant "print everything including
% trace", but is legal on GLogVerbosity, where it is the documented default.
%
% A non-numeric level returns true rather than false, so a malformed call site
% is loud instead of silently dropping its message forever.
%
% Parameters:
%   level - numeric verbosity level (see granary.Level)
%   dest  - 'any' (default), 'console' or 'log'
%
% Returns:
%   tf - logical scalar
%
% See also: granary.printf, granary.Level, granary.sink.Sink

% The Code Analyzer flags globals, but these are the package's established
% public controls: a host sets GVerbosity from its own settings UI or command
% line, and any library bridged into this logger reads the same switch. Taking
% them as arguments instead would break every one of those call sites and
% split each setting in two.
