classdef (Abstract) FileSink < granary.sink.Sink
% granary.sink.FileSink  Shared lifecycle for sinks that write a daily file.
%
% Owns everything the old logmessage subfunction did, with the parts that were
% costing time or hiding failures fixed:
%
%   * Rotation is a single datetime comparison against a cached midnight
%     boundary. The old code formatted the date to text on EVERY message just
%     to strcmp it against the previous day.
%   * No per-message ftell probe. The handle is trusted until a write actually
%     fails, and only then re-opened.
%   * fopen failure latches. The old code left the fid at -1, so needNewLog
%     stayed true and every later message retried the whole directory
%     resolution -- isfolder + mkdir + fopen -- silently, forever.
%   * flush() closes and reopens in append mode. MATLAB exposes no fflush, and
%     a buffered tail is exactly what gets lost in the crash the log exists to
%     explain. Records at or below FlushLevel flush automatically.
%   * PerProcess adds the process id to the filename, so several MATLAB
%     instances sharing one installation stop interleaving into one file.
%
% Subclasses supply formatLine() and extension().
%
% Verbosity for the file is GLogVerbosity, not GVerbosity: see accepts(). It
% defaults to Inf so quieting the command window never quiets the record of
% what happened.
%
% Properties:
%   Dir        - directory holding the log files
%   BaseName   - filename stem before the date
%   PerProcess - include the process id in the filename (default false)
%   FlushLevel - flush after any record at or below this level (default 0)
%   Path       - full path currently open (read-only)
%   Failed     - true once opening failed and logging was disabled (read-only)
